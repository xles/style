# Style

My personal collection of web styles I use in various projects.  These
stylesheets provide an attractive default for all standard html5 
markup.

The typography is largely based on Robert Bringhurst's "The elements of
typographic style" (fourth edition), combined with personal prefference
and slightly altered to fit the web.
